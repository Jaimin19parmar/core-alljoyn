This is an Eclipse Android project. In order to run this project,
the AllJoyn 'jar' and 'so' files must be added (AllJoyn release 16.10.01 or later).

Add the following jar files to a libs/ folder at the top of the project:
   alljoyn.jar
   alljoyn_config.jar

Add the following shared object file to the libs/armeabi/ folder:
   liballjoyn_java.so


Android Studio:
With the above libs/ folder added to the Eclipse project, importing the project
into Android Studio will automatically place these .jar/.so files at the following
locations in your new Android Studio project:
   app/libs/
   app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/
and will configure the app/build.gradle file with both jar files as dependencies.
