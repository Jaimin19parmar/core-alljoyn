This is an Android Studio project. In order to run this project,
the AllJoyn 'jar' and 'so' files must be added.

Add the following jar files in the app/libs/ folder:
   alljoyn.jar
   alljoyn_about.jar
   alljoyn_config.jar
   alljoyn_apps_andriod_utils.jar

Add the following shared object files to the app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/ folder:
   liballjoyn_java.so


This Secure Door Client app is used in conjunction with the Secure Door Service app,
and also requires use of the Security Manager application in order setup security
between the client and service apps.

Get started with security manager as follows:
1. Run secmgr.exe from under
      "%YourAllJoynBuildDirectory%\%OS%\%architecture%\(release|debug)\obj\alljoyn_core\samples\securitymgr\cli".
   This might be a good time to take a quick look at the available security manager commands by typing "h".
   Note: To run secmgr, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable may need to reference the security manager,
   alljoyn, and sqlite .so files.
2. Run the secure door client and service.
3. The security manager should display that it noticed two new, unclaimed apps.
4. Use the security manager to claim both applications. Use the "c [appID]" command to do that.
   For simplicity choose the NULL authentication for now and agree to the manifest templates the
   security manager will show you while claiming.
5. Create a group in the security manager ("g [someName]/[someDescription]"). For example: "g g/g".
6. Install a membership certificate on the client ("m [clientAppID] [groupID]").
7. Install a policy on the service to allow access to members of the new group ("o [serviceAppID] [groupID]").

Now you should be able to use the client and service apps to talk to each other.
