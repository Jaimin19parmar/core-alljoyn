This is the Security Manager app. It is used with the Secure Door Service app and the Secure
Door Client app.

Get started with security manager as follows:
1. Run the Security Manager
2. Run the secure door client and service.
3. The security manager should display that it noticed two new, unclaimed apps.
4. Use the security manager to claim both applications, by clicking on the apps.
5. Install a membership certificate on the client by long-clicking the client app and then clicking install membership.
6. Install a policy on the service to allow access to members by long-clicking the service app and then clicking install policy.

Now you should be able to use the client and service apps to talk to each other.
To go through this flow again, remove ~/.alljoyn_keystore/ before beginning.
