/*
 * How the transport fits into the system
 * ======================================
 *
 * AllJoyn provides the concept of a Transport which provides a relatively
 * abstract way for the daemon to use different network mechanisms for getting
 * Messages from place to another.  Conceptually, think of, for example, a Unix
 * transport that moves bits using unix domain sockets, a Bluetooth transport
 * that moves bits over a Bluetooth link and a TCP transport that moves Messages
 * over a TCP connection.  A UDP transport moves Messages over UDP datagrams
 * using a reliability layer.
 *
 * In networking 101, one discovers that BSD sockets is oriented toward clients
 * and servers.  There are different sockets calls required for a program
 * implementing a server-side part and a client side part.  The server-side
 * listens for incoming connection requests and the client-side initiates the
 * requests.  AllJoyn clients are bus attachments that our Applications may use
 * and these can only initiate connection requests to AllJoyn daemons.  Although
 * dameons may at first blush appear as the service side of a typical BSD
 * sockets client-server pair, it turns out that while daemons obviously must
 * listen for incoming connections, they also must be able to initiate
 * connection requests to other daemons.  This file is the UDPTransport.  It
 * needs to act as both a client and a server explains the presence of both
 * connect-like methods and listen-like methods here.
 *
 * A fundamental idiom in the AllJoyn system is that of a thread.  Active
 * objects in the system that have threads wandering through them will implement
 * Start(), Stop() and Join() methods.  These methods work together to manage
 * the autonomous activities that can happen in a UDPTransport.  These
 * activities are carried out by so-called hardware threads.  POSIX defines
 * functions used to control hardware threads, which it calls pthreads.  Many
 * threading packages use similar constructs.
 *
 * In a threading package, a start method asks the underlying system to arrange
 * for the start of thread execution.  Threads are not necessarily running when
 * the start method returns, but they are being *started*.  Some time later, a
 * thread of execution appears in a thread run function, at which point the
 * thread is considered *running*.  In the case of the UDPTransport, the Start() method
 * spins up a thread to run the basic maintenance operations such as deciding when
 * to listen and advertise.  Another thread(s) is started to deal with the actual
 * movement of UDP datagrams since this is a time-critical operation.  This
 * means that as soon as Start() is executed, multiple threads may be wandering
 * around uin the transport and so one must be very careful about resource
 * management.
 *
 * In generic threads packages, executing a stop method asks the underlying
 * system to arrange for a thread to end its execution.  The system typically
 * sends a message to the thread to ask it to stop doing what it is doing.  The
 * thread is running until it responds to the stop message, at which time the
 * run method exits and the thread is considered *stopping*.  The
 * UDPTransport provides a Stop() method to do exactly that.
 *
 * Note that neither of Start() nor Stop() are synchronous in the sense that one
 * has actually accomplished the desired effect upon the return from a call.  Of
 * particular interest is the fact that after a call to Stop(), threads will
 * still be *running* for some non-deterministic time.
 *
 * In order to wait until all of the threads have actually stopped, a blocking
 * call is required.  In threading packages this is typically called join, and
 * our corresponding method is called Join().  A user of the UDPTransport
 * must assume that immediately after a call to Start() is begun, and until a
 * call to Join() returns, there may be threads of execution wandering anywhere
 * in the transport and in any callback registered by the caller.
 *
 * The high-level process for how an advertisement translates into a transport
 * Connect() is a bit opaque, so we paint a high-level picture here.
 *
 * First, a service (that will be handling RPC calls and emitting signals)
 * acquires a name on the bus, binds a session and calls AdvertiseName.  This
 * filters down (possibly through language bindings) to the AllJoyn Object, into
 * the transports on the transport list (the UDP transport is one of those) and
 * eventually to the IpNameService::AdvertiseName() method we call since we are
 * an IP-based transport.  The IP name service will multicast the advertisements
 * to other daemons listening on our device's connected networks.
 *
 * A client that is interested in using the service calls the discovery
 * method FindAdvertisedName.  This filters down (possibly through
 * language bindings) to the AllJoyn object, into the transports on the
 * transport list (us) and we eventually call IpNameService::FindAdvertisedName()
 * since we are an IP-based transport.  The IP name service multicasts the
 * discovery message to other daemons listening on our networks.
 *
 * The daemon remembers which clients have expressed interest in which services,
 * and expects name services to call back with the bus addresses of daemons they
 * find which have the associated services.  When a new advertisement is
 * received (because we called our listener's Found() method here, the bus
 * address is "hidden" from interested clients and replaced with a more generic
 * TransportMask bit (for us it will be TRANSPORT_UDP).  The client either
 * responds by ignoring the advertisement, waits to accumulate more answers or
 * joins a session to the implied daemon/service.  A reference to a SessionOpts
 * object is provided as a parameter to a JoinSession call if the client wants
 * to connect.  This SessionOpts reference is passed down into the transport
 * (selected by the TransportMask) into the Connect() method which is used to
 * establish the connection.
 *
 * The four different connection mechanisms can be viewed as a matrix;
 *
 *                                                      IPv4               IPv6
 *                                                 ---------------    ---------------
 *     TRAFFIC MESSAGES | TRAFFIC_RAW_RELIABLE  |   Reliable IPv4      Reliable IPv6
 *     TRAFFIC_RAW_UNRELIABLE                   |  Unreliable IPv4    Unreliable IPv6
 *
 * Note that although the UDP protocol is unreliable, the AllJoyn Reliable Datagram
 * Protocol is an additional reliability layer, so that TRAFFIC_MESSAGES are actually
 * sent over the UDP protocol.

 * The bits in the provided SessionOpts select the row, but the column is left
 * free (unspecified).  This means that it is up to the transport to figure out
 * which one to use.  Clearly, if only one of the two address flavors is
 * possible (known from examining the returned bus address which is called a
 * connect spec in the Connect() method) the transport should choose that one.
 * If both IPv4 or IPv6 are available, it is up to the transport (again, us) to
 * choose the "best" method since we don't bother clients with that level of
 * detail.  We (UDP) generally choose IPv6 when given the choice since DHCP on
 * IPv4 is sometimes problematic in some networks.
 *
 * Internals
 * =========
 *
 * We spend a lot of time on the threading aspects of the transport since they
 * are often the hardest part to get right and are complicated.  This is where
 * the bugs live.
 *
 * As mentioned above, the AllJoyn system uses the concept of a Transport.  You
 * are looking at the UDPTransport.  Each transport also has the concept of an
 * Endpoint.  The most important function fo an endpoint is to provide (usually)
 * non-blocking semantics to higher level code.  If the source thread overruns
 * the ability of the transport to move bits (reliably), we do apply
 * back-pressure by blocking the calling thread, but usually a call to PushBytes
 * results in an immediate UDP datagram sendto.  In the UDP transport there are
 * separate worker threads assigned to reading UDP datagrams, running the
 * reliability layer and dispatching received AllJoyn messages.
 *
 * Endpoints are specialized into the LocalEndpoint and the RemoteEndpoint
 * classes.  LocalEndpoint represents a connection from a router to the local
 * bus attachment or daemon (within the "current" process).  A RemoteEndpoint
 * represents a connection from a router to a remote attachment or daemon.  By
 * definition, the UDPTransport provides RemoteEndpoint functionality.
 *
 * RemoteEndpoints are further specialized according to the flavor of the
 * corresponding transport, and so you will see a UDPEndpoint class defined
 * below which provides functionality to send messages from the local router to
 * a destination off of the local process using a UDP transport mechanism.
 *
 * RemoteEndpoints use AllJoyn stream objects to actually move bits.  In UDP
 * this is a bit of an oxymoron, however an AllJoyn stream is a thin layer on
 * top of a Socket (which is another thin layer on top of a BSD socket) that
 * provides PushBytes() and PullBytes() methods.  Although UDP is not a stream-
 * based protocol, we treat each received datagram as a separate stream for the
 * purposes of passing back to the AllJoyn core which expectes to be able to
 * read bytes from a message backing object.
 *
 * Unlike a TCP transport, receive threads in UDP are not associted with a
 * particular endpoint.  The job of the receive (worker) threads are to wait for
 * incoming UDP datagrams, to run the reliability layer and to unmarshal
 * incoming reassembled datagrams into AllJoyn Messages.  Once a worker thread
 * has a message, it calls into the daemon's Message router (PushMessage) to
 * arrange for delivery.  A separate thread runs the maintenance aspects of the
 * UDP reliability layer (to drive retransmissions, timeouts, etc.).
 *
 * The UDPEndpoint inherits the infrastructure requred to do much of its work
 * from the more generic RemoteEndpoint class.  Since the UDP transport is a not
 * a stream-based protocol, it does redefine some of the basic operation of the
 * RemoteEndpoint to suit its needs.  The UDP endpoint also needs to provide for
 * authenticating the endpoint before it is allowed to start pumping messages.
 * Authentication means running some mysterious (to us) process that may involve
 * some unknown number of challenge and response messsages being exchanged
 * between the client and server side of the connection.  Since we cannot block
 * a caller waiting for authentication, this must done on another thread; and
 * this must be done before the RemoteEndpoint is Start()ed -- before its
 * transmit and receive threads are started, lest they start pumping messages
 * and interfering with the authentication process.  This complicates the work
 * of the endpoing considerably.
 *
 * Authentication can, of course, succeed or fail based on timely interaction
 * between the two sides, but it can also be abused in a denial of service
 * attack.  If a client simply starts the process but never responds, it could
 * tie up a daemon's resources, and coordinated action could bring down a
 * daemon.  Because of this, we need to provide a way to reach in and abort
 * authentications that are "taking too long."
 *
 * As described above, a daemon can listen for inbound connections and it can
 * initiate connections to remote daemons.  Authentication must happen in both
 * cases.
 *
 * If you consider all that is happening, we are talking about a complicated
 * system of many threads that are appearing and disappearing in the system at
 * unpredictable times.  These threads have dependencies in the resources
 * associated with them (sockets and events in particular).  These resources may
 * have further dependencies that must be respected.
 *
 * To summarize, consider the following "big picture' view of the transport.  A
 * single UDPTransport is constructed if the daemon TransportList indicates that
 * UDP support is required.  The high-level daemon code (see bbdaemon.cc for
 * example) builds a TransportFactoryContainer that is initialized with a
 * factory that knows how to make UDPTransport objects if they are needed, and
 * associates the factory with the string "udp".  The daemon also constructs
 * "server args" which may contain the string "udp" or "tcp" or "bluetooth" or
 * "unix".  If the factory container provides a "udp" factory and the server
 * args specify a "udp" transport is needed then a UDPTransport object is
 * instantiated and entered into the daemon's internal transport list (list of
 * available transports).  Also provided for each transport is an abstract
 * address/port to listen for incoming connection requests on.
 *
 * When the daemon is brought up, its TransportList is Start()ed.  The transport
 * specs string (e.g., "unix:abstract=alljoyn;udp:;tcp:;bluetooth:") is provided
 * to TransportList::Start() as a parameter.  The transport specs string is
 * parsed and in the example above, results in "unix" transports, "tcp"
 * transports, "udp" transports and "bluetooth" transports being instantiated
 * and started.  As mentioned previously "udp" in the daemon translates into
 * UDPTransport.  Once the desired transports are instantiated, each is
 * Start()ed in turn.  In the case of the UDPTransport, this will start the
 * maintenance loop.  Initially there are no sockets to listen on.
 *
 * The daemon then needs to start listening on some inbound addresses and ports.
 * This is done by the StartListen() command which you can find in bbdaemon, for
 * example.  This also takes the same kind of server args string shown above but
 * this time the address and port information are used.  For example, one might
 * use the string "udp:addr=0.0.0.0,port=9955;" to specify which address and
 * port to listen to.  This Bus::StartListen() call is translated into a
 * UDPTransport::StartListen() call which is provided with the string
 * which we call a "listen spec".  Our StartListen() will create a Socket, bind
 * the socket to the address and port provided and save the new socket on a list
 * of "listenFds" (we may listen on separate sockets corresponding to multiple
 * network interfaces).   It will then Alert() the already running maintenance
 * thread -- see UDPTransport::Run().  Each time through the maintenance
 * loop, Run() will examine the list of listenFds and will associate an Event
 * with the corresponding socketFd and wait for inbound datagrams.
 *
 * There is a complementary call to stop listening on addresses.  Since the
 * protocol handler loop is depending on the associated sockets, StopListen must
 * not close those Sockets, it must ask the maintenance loop to do so in a
 * coordinated way.
 *
 * An inbound connection request in the UDP transport is consists of receiving a
 * SYN datagram.  A worker thread will handle the incoming request and create a
 * UDPEndpoint for the *proposed* new connection.  Recall that an endpoint is
 * not brought up immediately, but an authentication step must be performed.
 * The worker thread starts this process by placing the new UDPEndpoint on
 * an authList, or list of authenticating endpoints.  It then calls the endpoint
 * Authenticate() method which spins up an authentication thread and returns
 * immediately.  This process transfers the responsibility for the connection
 * and its resources to the authentication thread.  Authentication can succeed,
 * fail, or take to long and be aborted.
 *
 * If authentication succeeds, the authentication thread calls back into the
 * UDPTransport's Authenticated() method.  Along with indicating that
 * authentication has completed successfully, this transfers ownership of the
 * UDPEndpoint back to the UDPTransport from the authentication thread.  At this
 * time, the UDPEndpoint is Start()ed which enaables Message routing across the
 * transport.
 *
 * If the authentication fails, the authentication thread simply sets the
 * UDPEndpoint state to FAILED and exits.  The maintenance thread looks at
 * authenticating endpoints (those on the authList) each time through its loop.
 * If an endpoint has failed authentication, and its thread has actually gone
 * away (or more precisely is at least going away in such a way that it will
 * never touch the endpoint data structure again).  This means that the endpoint
 * can be deleted.
 *
 * If the authentication takes "too long" we assume that a denial of service
 * attack in in progress.  We call AuthStop() on such an endpoint.  This
 * AuthStop() will cause the endpoint to be scavenged using the above mechanism
 * the next time through the maintenance loop.
 *
 * A daemon transport can accept incoming connections, and it can make outgoing
 * connections to another daemon.  This case is simpler than the accept case
 * since it is expected that a socket connect can block higner level code, so it
 * is possible to do authentication in the context of the thread calling
 * Connect().  Connect() is provided a so-called "connect spec" which provides
 * an IP address ("u4addr=xxxx"), port ("y4port=yyyy") in a String.
 *
 * A check is always made to catch an attempt for the daemon to connect to
 * itself which is a system-defined error (it causes the daemon grief, so we
 * avoid it here by looking to see if one of the listenFds is listening on an
 * interface that corresponds to the address in the connect spec).
 *
 * If the connect is allowed, ee kick off a process in the underlying UDP reliability
 * layer that corresponds to the 3-way handshake of TCP.
 *
 * The next step is to create a UDPEndpoint and to put it on the endpointList.
 * Note that the endpoint doesn't go on the authList as in the server case, it
 * goes on the list of active endpoints.  This is because a failure to
 * authenticate on the client side results in a call to EndpointExit which is
 * the same code path as a failure when the endpoint is up.  The failing
 * endpoint must be on the endpoint list in order to allow authentication errors
 * to be propagated back to higher-level code in a meaningful context.  Once the
 * endpoint is stored on the list, Connect() starts client-side Authentication
 * with the remote (server) side.  If Authentication succeeds, the endpoint is
 * Start()ed as described above.  If authentication fails, the endpoint is
 * removed from the active list.  This is thread-safe since there is no
 * authentication thread running because the authentication was done in the
 * context of the thread calling Connect() which is the one deleting the
 * endpoint.
 *
 * Shutting the UDPTransport down involves orchestrating the orderly termination
 * of:
 *
 *   1) Threads that may be running in the maintenance loop with associated Events
 *      and their dependent socketFds stored in the listenFds list.
 *   2) Threads that may be running authentication with associated endpoint objects,
 *      streams and SocketFds.  These threads are accessible through endpoint objects
 *      stored on the authList.
 *   3) Worker threads that may be running and through endpoints which are up and
 *      running, transporting routable Messages through the system.
 *
 * Note that we also have to understand and deal with the fact that threads
 * running in state (2) above, will exit and depend on the maintenance loop to
 * scavenge the associated objects off of the authList and delete them.  This
 * means that the server maintenance loop cannot be Stop()ped until the authList
 * is empty.  We further have to understand that threads running in state (3)
 * above will depend on the hooked EndpointExit function.  We can't delete the
 * transport until all of its associated endpoint threads are Join()ed.  Also,
 * since the transmport may be looking at the list of listenFDs, we must be
 * careful about deleting those sockets out from under the server thread.  The
 * system should call StopListen() on all of the listen specs it called
 * StartListen() on; but we need to be prepared to clean up any "unstopped"
 * listen specs in a coordinated way.  This, in turn, means that the server
 * maintenance loop cannot be Stop()ped until all of the listenFds are cleaned
 * up.
 *
 * There are a lot of dependencies here, so be careful when making changes to
 * the thread and resource management here.  It's quite easy to shoot yourself
 * in multiple feet you never knew you had if you make an unwise modification,
 * and sometimes the results are tiny little time-bombs set to go off in
 * completely unrelated code (if, for example, a socket is deleted and reused
 * by another piece of code while the transport still has an event referencing
 * the socket now used by the other module).
 *
 * A note on connection establishment
 * ==================================
 *
 * In the TCP transport, a separate synchronous sequence is executed before
 * AllJoyn messages can begin flowing.  First a NUL byte is sent as is required
 * in the DBus spec.  In order to get a destination address for the BusHello
 * message, the local side relies on the SASL three-way handshake exchange:
 *
 *     AUTH ANONYMOUS ->
 *                       <- OK <GUID>
 *     BEGIN ---------->
 *
 * Once this is done, the active connector sends a BusHello Message and the
 * passive side sends a response
 *
 *     BusHello ------->
 *                       <- BusHello response
 *
 * In the UDP Transport, we get rid of basically the whole Authentication
 * process and exchange required information in the SYN, SYN + ACK and
 * ACK packets of the protocol three-way handshake.
 *
 * The initial SYN packet implies AUTH_ANONYMOUS and contains the BusHello
 * message data from the Local (initiating/active) side of the connection.
 * The SYN + ACK segment then contains the response to the BusHello that
 * was sent in the SYN packet.
 *
 *     SYN + BusHello -->
 *                        <- SYN + ACK + BusHello Reply
 *     ACK ------------->
 *
 * At this point, the connection is up and running.
 *
 * This exchange is implemented using a number of callback functions that
 * fire on the local (active) and remote (passive) side of the connection.
 *
 * 1) The actively connecting side provides a BusHello message in call to
 *    ARDP_Connect.  As described above, ARDP provides this message as data in
 *    the SYN segment which is the first part of the three-way handshake;
 *
 * 2) When the passive side receives the SYN segment, its AcceptCB callback is
 *    fired.  The data provided in the accept callback contains the BusHello
 *    message from the actively opening side.  The passive side, if it chooses
 *    to accept the connection, makes a call to ARDP_Accept with its reply to
 *    the BusHello from the active side as data.  ARDP provides this data back
 *    in the SYN + ACK segment as the second part of its three-way handshake;
 *
 * 3) The actively connecting side receives a ConnectCb callback as a result of
 *    the SYN + ACK coming back from the passive side.  This indicates that the
 *    newly established connection is going into the OPEN state from the local
 *    side's perspective.  This callback includes the data from the passive side
 *    that includes the reply to the active side's original BusHello message.
 *    The active opener then creates a reply to the BusHello message from the
 *    passive side and provides it to the function ARDP_Acknowledge.  This
 *    drives the ACK to the SYN + ACK and starts the third part of the three-way
 *    handshake.
 *
 * 4) When the final ACK of the three-way handshake is delivered to the passive
 *    opener side, it transitions the passive side to the OPEN state and fires
 *    the AcknowledgeCb callback.
 *
 * From the perspective of the UDP Transport, this translates into the following
 * sequence diagram that reflects the three-way handshake that is going on under
 * the whole thing.
 *
 *                       Active Side                                                  Passive Side
 *                       ===========                                                  ============
 *      ARDP_Connect([out]BusHello message) --> AcceptCb([in]BusHello message) -----+

     * we need to copy the data in and return immediately if there is no
     * backpressure from the protocol; or copy the data in and block the caller
     * if there is backpressure.  Backpressure is indicated by the

     * BUGBUG FIXME
     * TODO: NOTE that the blocking is on an endpoint-by-endpoint basis, which
     * means there is a write event per endpoint.  This could be changed to one
     * event per transport, but would mean waking all blocked threads only to
     * have one of them succeed and the rest go back to sleep if the event
     * wasn't directed at them.  This is the classic thundering herd, but trades
     * CPU for event resources which may be a good way to go since our events
     * can be so expensive.  It's a simple change conceptually but there is no
     * bradcast condition variable in common, which would be the way to go.
     *
     * For now, we will take the one event per endpoint approach and optimize
     * that as time permits.

/*
 * The purpose of this code is really to ensure that we don't have any listeners
 * active on Android systems if we have no ongoing advertisements.  This is to
 * satisfy a requirement driven from the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS)
 * which fails systems that have processes listening for UDP connections when
 * the test is run.
 *
 * Listeners and advertisements are interrelated.  In order to Advertise a
 * service, the name service must have an endpoint to include in its
 * advertisements; and there must be at least one listener running and ready to
 * receive connections before telling the name service to advertise.
 *
 * Discovery requests do not require listeners be present per se before being
 * forwarded to the name service.  A discovery request will ulitmately lead to a
 * bus-to-bus connection once a remote daemon has been discovered; but the local
 * side will always start the connection.  Sessions throw a bit of a monkey
 * wrench in the works, though.  Since a JoinSession request is sent to the
 * (already connected) remote daemon and it decides what to do, we don't want to
 * arbitrarily constrain the remote daemon by disallowing it to try and connect
 * back to the local daemon.  For this reason, we do require listeners to be
 * present before discovery starts.
 *
 * So the goal is to not have active listeners in the system unless there are
 * outstanding advertisements or discovery requests, but we cannot have
 * outstanding advertisements or discovery requests until there are active
 * listeners.  Some care is obviously required here to accomplish this
 * seemingly inconsistent behavior.
 *
 * We call the state of no outstanding advertisements and not outstanding
 * discovery requests "Name Service Quiescent".  In this case, the name service
 * must be disabled so that it doesn't interact with the network and cause a CTS
 * failure.  As soon as a either a discovery request or an advertisement request
 * is started, we need to enable the name service to recieve and send network
 * packets, which will cause the daemon process to begin listening on the name
 * service well-known UDP port.
 *
 * Before an advertisement or a discovery request can acutally be sent over the
 * wire, we must start a listener which will receive connection requests, and
 * we must provide the name service with endpoint information that it can include
 * in its advertisement.  So, from the name service and network perspective,
 * listens must preceed advertisements.
 *
 * In order to accomplish the CTS requirements, however, advertisements must
 * preceed listens.  It turns out that this is how the high-level system wants
 * to work.  Essentually, the system calls StartListen at the beginning of time
 * (when the daemon is first brought up) and it calls StopListen at the end of
 * time (when the daemon is going down).  Advertisements and discovery requests
 * come and go in between as clients and services come up and go down.
 *
 * To deal with this time-inversion, we save a list of all listen requests, a
 * list of all advertisement requests and a list of all discovery requests.  At
 * the beginning of time we get one or more StartListen calls and save the
 * listen specs, but do not actually do the socket operations to start the
 * corresponding socket-level listens.  When the first advertisement or
 * discovery request comes in from the higher-level code, we first start all of
 * the saved listens and then enable the name service and ask it to start
 * advertising or discovering as appropriate.  Further advertisements and
 * discovery requests are also saved, but the calls to the name service are
 * passed through when it is not quiescent.
 *
 * We keep track of the disable advertisement and discovery calls as well.  Each
 * time an advertisement or discover operation is disabled, we remove the
 * corresponding entry in the associated list.  As soon as all advertisements
 * and discovery operations are disabled, we disable the name service and remove
 * our UDP listeners, and therefore remove all listeners from the system.  Since
 * we have a saved a list of listeners, they can be restarted if another
 * advertisement or discovery request comes in.
 *
 * We need to do all of this in one place (here) to make it easy to keep the
 * state of the transport (us) and the name service consistent.  We are
 * basically a state machine handling the following transitions:
 *
 *   START_LISTEN_INSTANCE: An instance of a StartListen() has happened so we
 *     need to add the associated listen spec to our list of listeners and be
 *     ready for a subsequent advertisement.  We expect these to happen at the
 *     beginning of time; but there is nothing preventing a StartListen after we
 *     start advertising.  In this case we need to execute the start listen.
 *
 *   STOP_LISTEN_INSTANCE: An instance of a StopListen() has happened so we need
 *     to remove the listen spec from our list of listeners.  We expect these to
 *     happen at the end of time; but there is nothing preventing a StopListen
 *     at any other time.  In this case we need to execute the stop listen and
 *     remove the specified listener immediately
 *
 *   ENABLE_ADVERTISEMENT_INSTANCE: An instance of an EnableAdvertisement() has
 *     happened.  If there are no other ongoing advertisements, we need to
 *     enable the stored listeners, pass the endpoint information down to the
 *     name servcie, enable the name service communication with the outside
 *     world if it is disabled and finally pass the advertisement down to the
 *     name service.  If there are other ongoing advertisements we just pass
 *     down the new advertisement.  It is an AllJoyn system programming error to
 *     start advertising before starting at least one listen.
 *
 *   DISABLE_ADVERTISEMENT_INSTANCE: An instance of a DisableAdvertisement()
 *     call has happened.  We always want to pass the corresponding Cancel down
 *     to the name service.  If we decide that this is the last of our ongoing
 *     advertisements, we need to continue and disable the name service from
 *     talking to the outside world.  For completeness, we remove endpoint
 *     information from the name service.  Finally, we shut down our UDP
 *     transport listeners.
 *
 *   ENABLE_DISCOVERY_INSTANCE: An instance of an EnableDiscovery() has
 *     happened.  This is a fundamentally different request than an enable
 *     advertisement.  We don't need any listeners to be present in order to do
 *     discovery, but the name service must be enabled so it can send and
 *     receive WHO-HAS packets.  If the name service communications are
 *     disabled, we need to enable them.  In any case we pass the request down
 *     to the name service.
 *
 *   DISABLE_DISCOVERY_INSTANCE: An instance of a DisableDiscovery() call has
 *     happened.  There is no corresponding disable call in the name service,
 *     but we do have to decide if we want to disable the name service to keep
 *     it from listening.  We do so if this is the last discovery instance and
 *     there are no other advertisements.
 *
 * There are five member variables that reflect the state of the transport
 * and name service with respect to this code:
 *
 *   m_isListening:  The list of listeners is reflected by currently listening
 *     sockets.  We have network infrastructure in place to receive inbound
 *     connection requests.
 *
 *   m_isNsEnabled:  The name service is up and running and listening on its
 *     sockets for incoming requests.
 *
 *   m_isAdvertising: We are advertising at least one well-known name either actively or quietly .
 *     If we are m_isAdvertising then m_isNsEnabled must be true.
 *
 *   m_isDiscovering: The list of discovery requests has been sent to the name
 *     service.  If we are m_isDiscovering then m_isNsEnabled must be true.
