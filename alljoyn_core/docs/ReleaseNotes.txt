Compatibility
-------------
Version 16.04:
* ECDHE_PSK authentication mechanism has been marked deprecated. Use ECDHE_SPEKE
  or some other authentication mechanism instead of ECDHE_PSK (ASACORE-2055)
* Some of the qcc::String methods have been marked deprecated (ASACORE-2274)
* Apps calling AllJoynShutdown before waiting for all Standard Core Threads to
  finish execution will trigger a failed assertion on Debug builds and possibly
  an application crash on Release builds. Applications should use 
  BusAttachment::Join() to wait for threads to finish execution (ASACORE-2811)
* Security 2.0 methods BusAttachment::AddApplicationStateRule and BusAttachment::
  RemoveApplicationStateRule were not needed so they have been removed (ASACORE-2683)
* Language tag matching uses prefix matching and also will return the default
  language if there is no match where previously it would return an
  error. (ASACORE-2209)
* Claimed 15.09 apps/devices (A/D using Security 2.0) cannot interact securely
  with pre-15.09 A/D using ECDHE_ECDSA key exchange; further, if the A/D only
  exposes interfaces/objects requiring security it will not be possible to
  interact with the A/D. This is because once an A/D is claimed, it expects to
  receive a manifest from the ECDHE_ECDSA peer, and pre-15.09 A/D do not support
  sending manifests (which were introduced as part Security 2.0 in the 15.09
  release).
