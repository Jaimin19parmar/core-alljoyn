Features added in Version 15.04a
--------------------------------
* Property cache feature which adds a simple, optional cache to ProxyBusObject
  that keeps track of property values as received in GetProperty,
  GetAllProperties calls and PropertiesChanged signals. (ASACORE-1569)
* Support for X.509 ECDSA digital certificates, which replace the X.509 RSA
  certificates. (ASACORE-1561)
* Remove excessive name transfer for all sessions. This limits the names
  exchanged to just the routing node and host/joiners as a part of an effort to
  reduce network traffic. (ASACORE-1392)
* Observer Functionality: this feature simplifies interface based discovery of
  bus objects by filtering such that listeners only trigger if something
  relevant has changed in an About Announcement. It also enables automatic
  session setup and takes care of proxy bus object creation and life-cycle
  management. (ASACORE-1383)
* It is now possible to build for Android without requiring OpenSSL from the
  platform, this greatly simplifies making Android builds. (ASACORE-1248)
* Add to About C API: a second announce_using_datalistener method was added that
  takes as argument an AboutDataListener instead of AboutData. (ASACORE-1363)
* Add support for detecting idle RNs allowing the RN to shut down automatically
  if no LNs have used its services for a while. (ASACORE-1186)
* Support for iOS 8.1 (ASACORE-936)

Compatibility
-------------
Version 15.04:
* The AllJoyn Protocol Version changed from 11 to 12. While routers will support
  applications using older versions, the reverse is not true; i.e. applications
  requiring version 12 router features of will not work with older routers.
* Uncrustify (white space checker) was migrated from v0.57 to v0.61; not
  updating the tool chain will cause the builds to break (ASACORE-1026)
* Applications are now required to call AllJoynInit() before any other AllJoyn
  calls,and AllJoynShutdown() after all other AllJoyn calls are complete
  (ASACORE-1342); as such, it is a change to the developer APIs, not to the wire
  protocol and will not impact inter-version inter-operability.
* The names that are exchanged between Routers have changed (ASACORE-1392);
  specifically the number of names exchanged between 15.04 nodes has been
  greatly reduced, but is not expected to create inter-version compatibility
  issues as the original behavior is executed when interacting with older
  routers.  The change also has some API changes that *may* have an impact on
  developers.
* The handling of ProxyBusObjects has changed to make them more sharable. Public
  APIs were deprecated and new calls were added. PropertyChangedListener
  callbacks get passed a new instance of ProxyBusObject that references the
  state information of the ProxyBusObject the listener was registered with.  If
  a derived class was registered instead, the PropertyChangedListener cannot
  cast the returned ProxyBusObject instance back into the derived class.  If
  information from the derived class needs to be delivered to the callback, then
  it must be passed in as a context pointer. More details can be found in
  ASACORE-1522.
* Header compression support was removed (ASACORE-1534).  This will only be an
  issue in the case where some applications are enabling header
  compression. This is unlikely as the feature was added to support sending
  small signals over BT carriers, and BT hasn't been a supported transport since
  pre-AllSeen AllJoyn releases.
* The removal of PIN_KEYX from Standard Core Library (ASACORE-1641) will
  introduce inter-version inter-operability issues in the following scenarios:
  1) Pre-14.06 TC applications will not be able to connect to secured 15.04
     Routing Nodes.
  2) Any pre-15.04 applications that expose or use secure interfaces and only
     support PIN_KEYX will no longer work with their 15.04 or later peers.
* Support for DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication was removed (ASACORE-1713) - this
  means that as of 15.04 it will not be possible to use the Standard Core
  Library with the D-Bus Daemon if that authentication method is required.
* Support for RSA authentication has been removed (ASACORE-1716); X.509-based
  certificate authentication is instead supported with ECDSA (ASACORE-1561).
* Support for SPKI certificates for ECDHE_ECDSA was removed; as there were no
  public APIs exposing this functionality the impact of this change is expected
  to be minimal.
* Multipoint session member attach does not work in some backward compatibility
  scenarios (ASACORE-1738)
* The default configuration of the Windows Routing Node (daemonlib.dll) has
  changed to accept connections on TCP port 9955 instead of TCP port 9956
  (ASACORE-2000); the default bus connect spec on Windows has been changed
  accordingly. Older Windows apps (using the older default bus connect spec)
  will no longer be able to connect to a 15.04a routing node. These apps should
  be recompiled using the new default connect spec. They may also require
  changes to your firewall settings.
* Another impact of ASACORE-2000 is 15.04a Bundled Routers now only accept
  connections on ephemeral TCP and UDP ports and don’t accept any connections
  using other transports. This means that applications using the default bus
  connect spec can no longer connect to a 15.04a Bundled Router on the local
  machine that is using the default bundledConfig settings.
* The SessionListener::SessionLost(SessionId sessionId) callback (which has been
  deprecated since before 14.02) has been removed (ASACORE-2048). Applications
  should instead use:
  SessionListener::SessionLost(SessionId sessionId, SessionLostReason reason)
  By example the following sample source code has been updated with this change:
  * alljoyn_core/samples/eventaction/SimpleRulesEngine/Rule.cc
  * services/about/cpp/samples/AboutClientSample/AboutClientSessionListener.cc
  Existing applications recompiled with this release will notice that their
  SessionLost(SessionId sessionId) callback will no longer be called.
